				apstrata enables <strong>true rich client</strong> development by providing the missing server side, we call 
				it <a href="#sub:sldTrueClient">Client2Cloud development</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Our services allow developers to invest the power of both Rich Client & Cloud computing to deliver
				better, more user friendly applications with radically shorter time to market and smaller cost to implement 
				and manage. 
			</li>
			<li>
				With few client-side lines of code to initiate and process a REST API call, a developer could persist or query
				data without needing custom application server code to broker the transaction with the database.
			</li>
			<li>
				But we can do much more than persistence, that's why we call our ecosystem <strong>Active Data Hub</strong>. 
				We also provide digital asset support, repository management, version control, full-text search, 
				user & identity management, security, webhooks, push notifications, workflow and more.
			</li>
			<li>
				In short, the apstrata ecosystem doesn't just passively store data, you can program it to react to changes and do all kinds
				of useful operations with your data. You can use apstrata to <strong>authenticate, orchestrate, integrate and process
				rules</strong> all without any need the traditional application server stack.

			<p>
				We coined <strong>Client2Cloud</strong> as a parallel to the older <strong>Client/Server</strong> paradigm. In those environments,
				the application was implemented the entire application in the 'thick' client platform and used the back end for 
				persistence. 
			</p>	
			<p>
				We consider that environments promoting <strong>true rich client</strong> development are only those that allow the application 
				programmer to work in the client side technology to implement the application page flow and business logic.
			</p>
			<p>
				In contrast, traditional application server stack supported development models require the application developer to work
				most of the time on the server side to implement client side functionality. This is even true if the front-end 
				is implemented in an Rich Internet Application (RIA) platform such as Flex.
