	<h1>apstrata data model</h1>
	
	<p>
		The apstrata database model is based on stores, documents, fields and queries. The store is a container of data represented 
		in documents, while documents contain fields with data, and queries are used to extract these documents from the specified
		stores.
	</p>
	<p>
		For those of you who are familiar with RDBMS: Data is stored in stores that correspond to databases, while documents are 
		similar to row entries identified by their store-unique document key. Fields are similar to columns in a table, except 
		that they can be associated with multiple values. On the other hand, data retrieval is done by using queries equivalent 
		to SQL queries in logic but differing in syntax.
	</p>

	<p>
		apstrata provides 3 API calls to manipulate stores:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>CreateStore:</b> Creates an apstrata database store which is the apstrata database equivalent of a database. 
								Clients will create a store in order to store any documents, or files for a certain application. 
								Only owners have the permission to use the CreateStore operation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>DeleteStore:</b> Deletes the clientâ€Ÿs store and all documents and files associated with it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>ListStores:</b> Returns a list of stores created by a client identified by their API key
			</li>
		</ul>
