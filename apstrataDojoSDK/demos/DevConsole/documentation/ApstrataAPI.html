	<h1>apstrata API</h1>
	
	<p>
apstrata Web APIs are a simple and more efficient alternative to the current multi- tiered application development paradigms and are usable by any cloud based platform or framework such as PHP, Ruby, Python etc. By substituting the current back-end tiers (typically application and database servers) with service oriented application building blocks, apstrata Cloud-based APIs provide a means to accelerate development of web 2.0 enterprise grade cloud based applications.
The first Web service to be launched is apstrata database. This is a new generation database service providing a "document" (or "object") paradigm. apstratabase is an operational database for e-business applications providing a more natural abstraction for storing business objects than the classical relational model.
